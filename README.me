# Arduino Buoy


## Overview
This is a framework for an oceanic buoy designed with a simple Arduino and off-the-shelf components, implemented in C++, Python and MATLAB.

It provides a script to load in an Arduino Nano board, equipped with a MPU9250 inertial measurement unit.

The framework also include analysis scripts in Python and MATLAB.

The buoy is designed to map the ocean swell by integrating accelerations, and filter them with a Kalman filter.
